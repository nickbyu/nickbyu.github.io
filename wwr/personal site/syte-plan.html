      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hey, I’m Nick, and I have a question for you! Remember how once you were a student? Or are you a current student? Are you an international student? I know that not many people can afford to have a perfect student’s life. How do I know that? Because I am a current student from another country at the US university! And my goal is to help others like me to survive and to succeed no matter how hard it is. I am building a web site which will collect the most useful information that have helped me and can help every student with every life aspect. Socializing, finances, time management, food etc. No matter what your problem is you will find help in my website.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This will be a website for mostly freshmen international students, that might have a hard time finding things that they need. Things on campus, cheap clothes and groceries. Fun and useful things to do on campus and outside of it.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>[Page 2 - Finances]</h3>
      <p>
        Finances can be a huge problem for someone who arrived to the US's university. It is especially annoying when you are only allowed to work on campus. First, try to actually apply for a job, lots of opportunities can be found on campus. Simply click <a href = "https://web.byui.edu/studentemployment/" target = "_self">HERE</a> to see the openings! Remember that there is also Financial services that you can access <a href = "https://www.byui.edu/financial-services" target = "_self">HERE</a>. <br>
        One thing that I don't really recomend but it helped me a quite a bit with finances is donating plasma. Plasma centers in Rexburg require you to have a social security number, and the only thing to get is to work on campus. But, there is a place in Idaho Falls that allowes international people to donate without social. Try to find a friend with a car and go there together, <a href = "https://www.biolifeplasma.com/" target = "_self">All the info can be found here</a>
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3 - Other stuff]</h3>
      <p>
        Socializing can be challenging sometimes, but there is a ton of fun activities that you can do on campus. Laser tag, dances, karaoke, and a lot more, <a href = "https://www.byui.edu/activities" target = "_self">Check it out</a><br>
        A good way to meet new people is to do some volunteering activities <a href = "https://www.byui.edu/get-involved" target = "_self">check it out</a><br>
        Keep in mind if you have a health problem, it's better to resolve it right away, because health care in the US is VERY expencive. Make sure you have a health insurance for it, and if needed go to <a href = "https://www.byui.edu/health-and-wellness-services" target = "_self">Health center</a>
